Web stack focussed on accessibility and security without sacrificing any dev workflow
```

## Goals

*This Project is still in development and as of yet not all of those goals are reached. So this is also like a semi roadmap indicated by the checkmarks.*

This Template is designed with the following goals:

Accessibility:

- good development workflow ‚úÖ
- easily self-hostable ‚úÖ
- conform to "WAI-ARIA" Standards 
- small footprint ‚úÖ
- SEO ‚úÖ
- Dockerized Production Preview ‚úÖ

Security:

- Content Security Policy headers ‚úÖ
- functional in JavaScript disabled browsers ‚úÖ
- hardened .htaccess ‚ùå
- 2fa and strict password guidelines ‚ùå
- dockerized deployment behind hardened reverse proxy ‚ùå

## Installation

Clone this repository and run:

```
composer install
```

```
npm install
```

## Development

Start vite's dev server and a simple php dev server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:8888` in the browser. Vite's dev server (`localhost:3000`) is only used for serving js, css and assets.

## Preview

Get a local production preview by running:

```
npm run preview
```


### Docker

This Repo provides a full dockerized production preview based on ubuntu running an apache webserver. It requires a rebuild everytime the apache configuration or the image spec is changed.

Build and run the preview container:

```
npm run docker:rebuild
```

Run the container:

```
npm run docker:preview
```

### Podman

Podman is supported. Simply replace docker with podman:

```
npm run podman:rebuild
npm run podman:preview
```

## Production

Build your optimized frontend assets to `public/dist`:

```
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Manually

Upload the repository to your web server and point your web server to the repository's `public` folder.
