Web stack focussed on accessibility and security without sacrificing the dev workflow
```

## Goals

*This Project is still in development and as of yet not all of those goals are reached. So this is also like a semi roadmap.*

This Template is designed with the following goals:

Accessibility:

- easy to develop
- easy to self-host
- conform to "WAI-ARIA" Standards
- small footprint
- SEO

Security:

- Content Security Policy headers
- functional in JavaScript disabled browsers
- hardened .htaccess
- 2fa and strict password guidelines
- dockerized deployment behind hardened reverse proxy

## Installation

Clone this repository and run:

```
composer install
```

```
npm install
```

## Development

Start vite's dev server and a simple php dev server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:8888` in the browser. Vite's dev server (`localhost:3000`) is only used for serving js, css and assets.

## Preview

Get a local production preview by running:

```
npm run preview
```

## Production

Build your optimized frontend assets to `public/dist`:

```
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Manually

Upload the repository to your web server and point your web server to the repository's `public` folder.
